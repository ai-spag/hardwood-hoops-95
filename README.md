⚙️ Gameplay Mechanics
Scoring
Score 2 points for each successful hoop! 🎯

After a score, possession automatically switches to the opposing team. 🔄

Possession & The Shot Clock
Initial Possession: Pacers (you!) start with the ball.

Shot Clock: 24 seconds to shoot! ⏱️

If time runs out, it's a turnover & AI gets the ball. 🚨

Loose Balls: Missed shot + inbounds = loose ball! Shot clock keeps ticking! 🏃‍♂️

Be quick! Grab it with X (or AI will grab it automatically!).

Steals & Out of Bounds: These also result in turnovers, switching possession. 🤝

"On Fire" Trait 🔥
Make 3 shots in a row to go "On Fire"! You'll get a fiery visual and a significant accuracy boost.

Miss a shot, and the streak resets. 🥶

🤖 The Thunder AI
The opposing Thunder team is smart, and they learn!

Movement: Adaptive! They'll find open shots on offense and guard you on defense.

Offensive Evasion: If you get too close while they have the ball, they'll attempt to evade you by moving diagonally. ➡️↘️↙️

Improved Shooting: The AI has refined shot mechanics for higher accuracy. 🎯

Progressive Steal Threat: The AI will actively try to steal from you! The chance of a steal increases with each quarter, making defense tougher. 📈

Dynamic Difficulty Spike: When Pacers reach 6 points, watch out! 😱

Thunder AI's movement speed dramatically increases! 💨

Their shooting accuracy becomes even higher! 🎯🎯

💡 Strategy Tips
Offense (Player):

Create Space: Use movement to shake defenders before shooting. 💨

Perfect Your Shot: Practice Z-key timing for various distances. 📏

Offensive Rebounds: Don't give up on misses! Grab loose balls with X for second chances! ⛹️‍♀️

Exploit "On Fire": Sink those shots while hot! 🔥

Defense (Player):

Tight Guarding: Stay close to the AI to contest shots. 🔒

Go for Steals: If the AI is dribbling near you, hit X for a risky (but rewarding!) steal. Timing is key! ⚡

Defensive Rebounds: Anticipate AI misses and grab the ball to start your offense. 🏐

Now go out there and show them who's boss on the hardwood! Good luck, and have fun! 🎉
