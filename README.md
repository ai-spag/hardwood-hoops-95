## ⚙️ Gameplay Mechanics

### Scoring

* Each time the ball successfully goes through your offensive hoop (the one on the right for the Pacers), your team scores **2 points**. 🎯
* After any score, possession automatically switches to the opposing Thunder team. 🔄

### Possession & The Shot Clock

* **Initial Possession:** You (the Pacers) start with the ball to kick things off.
* **Shot Clock:** A 24-second shot clock is active whenever your team has possession. ⏱️
    * If you fail to shoot the ball before the shot clock expires, it's a **shot clock violation** (turnover), and possession transfers to the Thunder. 🚨
* **Loose Balls:** If a shot misses the hoop and the ball lands inbounds, it becomes loose. Critically, the shot clock **continues to run**! 🏃‍♂️
    * Both you and the AI can grab a loose ball. Be quick! Grabbing a loose ball initiates a new possession and resets the shot clock.
* **Steals & Out of Bounds:** If you successfully steal the ball, or if the ball goes out of bounds, it results in a turnover, and possession changes teams. 🤝

### "On Fire" Trait 🔥

* Make **3 shots in a row**, and your player goes "On Fire"! This is indicated by a fiery visual effect around your player.
* While "On Fire," your player's **shooting accuracy is significantly boosted**, making it much easier to sink those shots!
* A single missed shot will reset your "On Fire" streak. 🥶

## 🤖 The Thunder AI

The opposing Thunder team is controlled by a cunning AI that gets tougher as you play!

* **Adaptive Movement:** The AI moves intelligently, seeking open shots on offense and guarding you tightly on defense.
* **Offensive Evasion:** If you get too close while the AI has the ball, it will try to **evade** you by moving strategically to create space. ➡️↘️↙️
* **Improved Shooting:** The AI employs refined shot mechanics, boasting **higher shooting accuracy**. 🎯
* **Progressive Steal Threat:** The AI will actively attempt to **steal the ball** from you when you're within its reach. The chance of a successful steal **increases with each quarter**, making defensive plays a growing challenge. 📈
* **Dynamic Difficulty Spike:** Be warned! Once your team (the Pacers) reaches a score of **6 points**, the Thunder AI unleashes a significant boost: 😱
    * Its **movement speed dramatically increases!** 💨
    * Its **shooting accuracy becomes even higher**, making it a formidable scoring threat! 🎯🎯

## 💡 Strategy Tips

* **Offense (Player):**
    * **Get Open:** Use your movement to create separation from the AI defender before attempting your shot. 🤸‍♂️
    * **Charge Wisely:** Practice holding the **`Z` key** to find the optimal shot power for various distances, from quick layups to powerful jumpers. 📏
    * **Rebound!** Don't just watch your misses! If the ball stays inbounds, quickly move your player to the landing spot and press **`X`** to secure that crucial offensive rebound for second-chance points. ⛹️‍♀️
    * **Exploit "On Fire":** Once you're hot, take full advantage of your improved accuracy to build a commanding lead! 🔥
* **Defense (Player):**
    * **Stay Close:** When the AI has possession, stick to them like glue to contest their shots and limit open looks. 🔒
    * **Go for Steals:** If you're near the AI player while they're dribbling, press **`X`** to attempt a risky (but potentially rewarding!) steal. Timing is everything! ⚡
    * **Defensive Rebounds:** Anticipate where the AI's missed shots will land and grab the ball to transition swiftly to offense. 🏐
