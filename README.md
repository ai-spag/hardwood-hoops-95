Hardwood Hoops '95: Official Game Manual
Welcome to Hardwood Hoops '95! Get ready to experience fast-paced, retro basketball action. This manual will guide you through the controls, gameplay mechanics, and strategies to dominate the court.

1. Getting Started
Hardwood Hoops '95 is a browser-based game. Simply open the HTML file in your web browser to start playing.

Game Objective: Score more points than the Thunder AI team before time runs out (though currently, there's no quarter or game clock beyond the shot clock).

2. Controls
Mastering these simple controls is key to becoming a hoops legend!

Move: Use the Arrow Keys (← ↑ ↓ →) to control your Pacers player.
Shoot / Dunk:
Hold down the Z Key to charge your shot. A power bar will appear above your player, filling up as you charge.
Release the Z Key to shoot the ball. The longer you hold it, the more powerful your shot will be.
Tip: Get close to the hoop for a higher chance of a dunk!
Grab Ball / Steal: Press the X Key.
When the ball is loose (e.g., after a missed shot, rebound, or turnover) and you're close enough, press X to grab possession.
When the AI player has the ball and you're close, pressing X gives you a chance to steal it.
Pause Game: Press the P Key to pause or unpause the game at any time.
3. Gameplay Mechanics
Understanding how the game works will help you make better strategic decisions.

3.1 Scoring
When the ball successfully goes through your offensive hoop (the hoop on the right side of the court for the Pacers), your team scores 2 points.
After a score, possession automatically switches to the opposing team (the Thunder).
3.2 Possession & The Shot Clock
Initial Possession: The Pacers (you) start with the ball.
Shot Clock: A 24-second shot clock is active for the team with possession.
If you fail to shoot the ball before the shot clock expires, it results in a shot clock violation (turnover), and possession transfers to the Thunder.
Loose Balls: If a shot misses the hoop and the ball lands inbounds, it becomes loose. The shot clock continues to run!
Either player (you or the AI) can grab the loose ball by moving close and pressing X (for you) or automatically (for the AI). Grabbing a loose ball initiates a new possession, resetting the shot clock.
Steals: If you successfully steal the ball from the AI (or the AI from you), possession changes, and the shot clock resets.
Out of Bounds: If the ball goes off the screen, it's considered out of bounds, resulting in a turnover and possession changing.
3.3 "On Fire" Trait
If your player makes 3 shots in a row, they'll become "On Fire"! This is indicated by a fiery visual effect around your player.
While "On Fire," your player's shooting accuracy is significantly boosted, making it easier to sink those shots.
The "On Fire" streak resets if you miss a shot.
4. The Thunder AI
The opposing Thunder team is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence, and it gets tougher as you play!

Movement: The AI moves adaptively, trying to find open shots on offense and guarding you tightly on defense.
Stealing: The AI will actively try to steal the ball from you when you're within its reach. The chance of a successful steal increases with each quarter, making it a growing threat.
Dynamic Difficulty Spike: Be warned! Once your team (the Pacers) reaches a score of 6 points, the Thunder AI will get a significant boost:
Its movement speed will dramatically increase.
Its shooting accuracy will become much higher, meaning it will miss far fewer shots.
5. Strategy Tips
Offense (Player):
Get Open: Use your movement to create space from the AI defender before attempting a shot.
Charge Wisely: Practice holding the Z key to find the right shot power for different distances. A quick tap for layups, a longer charge for jumpers.
Rebound! Don't just watch your missed shots! If the ball stays inbounds, quickly move your player to the ball's landing spot and press X to secure the offensive rebound. This is crucial for second-chance points.
Exploit "On Fire": Once you're "On Fire," try to take advantage of your improved accuracy to build a lead.
Defense (Player):
Stay Close: When the AI has the ball, try to stay close to them to limit their open shots.
Go for Steals: If you're close to the AI when it's dribbling, press X to try and steal the ball. Timing is key!
Defensive Rebounds: Just like on offense, if the AI misses a shot, try to grab the loose ball before they do.
Now you're equipped with the knowledge to step onto the virtual court and show off your skills in Hardwood Hoops '95! Good luck, and have fun!
